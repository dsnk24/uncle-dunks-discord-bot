**Uncle Dunk v1.6.7 is out now!**
:speaker: Uncle Dunk update 1.6.7 contains some cool new features, like:
    - New category of commands called `Roles`!
    - Bug fixes!
    - New utility commands!

Also, removed Christmas category, since Christmas is sadly over. :(

On a cheerier note, I'm working on a web dashboard for Uncle Dunk and a new leaderboard system!
